The Darkness is a mysterious and ancient entity which acts as the direct enemy to the similarly ancient Traveler. As the antithesis to The Traveler, it was the cause of the Collapse which ended the great Golden Age of humanity. During the last battle between the Traveler and the Darkness, the Traveler sacrificed itself in defense of humanity, temporarily saving it from annihilation. After the battlegrounds fell silent, the Traveler sat, dormant and silent, hovering above Earth and protecting The City.
-
Because the final battle happened so long ago in the history of Destiny, few remember the exact scope and nature of the Darkness, remembering only that it was terrible and its evil was beyond measure. Now, with the Traveler silent and wounded, the Darkness has returned to finish its course of war. The Guardians, bestowed powers by the Traveler, are doing all they can to push the evil back, searching for a way to bring the Traveler back.
-
The Guardians face steep opposition however: just as the Guardians are granted powers by the Traveler, so too are the Fallen, Vex, Cabal, and Hive species empowered and emboldened by the Darkness.
