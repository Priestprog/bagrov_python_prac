The Golden Age for Humanity was set in motion by the arrival of the Traveler, which allowed Humans to expand throughout the solar system. During this time Humanity prospered. The Human empire ever expanded and grew and it was a time of peace. Eventually, whether it be because the Humans expanded and grew too far or just a random event the Collapse occurred plunging Humanity into darkness and near extermination. All that remains is the last city saved by the Traveler and protected by its Guardians. The Golden Age is over now, but the Guardians venture forth into the frontier to face Humanity's enemies and try to reclaim what was lost to them.
